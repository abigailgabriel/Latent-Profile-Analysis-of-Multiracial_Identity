# Latent-Profile-Analysis-of-Multiracial_Identity

The current study presents a statistical model of the roles of racial identity, racial identification,
and racial category under the ecological framework for understanding multiracial identity. The
purposes of this study were threefold: (1) to identify distinct profiles of how multiracials
understand their racial identity using latent profile analysis; (2) to investigate whether racial
identification variables predicted profile membership; and (3) to examine whether profile
membership differentiated multiracials across racial category and adjustment outcomes. Using a
sample of 269 multiracial adults (77% female, Mage = 23.10) recruited from a southwestern
university in 2018, we identified three profiles of racial identity orientations: Singular-oriented
(9%; n = 23), Border-oriented (45%; n = 120), and Protean-oriented (47%; n = 126). The
Singular-oriented profile was characterized by the highest level of racial distance, and the lowest
levels of multiracial pride, challenges with racial identity, and creating a third space. The Borderoriented profile was characterized by the lowest level of racial distance, and the highest level of
multiracial pride. The Protean-oriented profile was characterized by the highest levels of racial
conflict, challenges with racial identity, and shifting racial expressions. Several racial
identification variables significantly predicted profile membership, including gender, Black
racial heritage, and perceived racial ambiguity. Furthermore, the three racial identity profiles
predicted variation in racial typology choices, proximity to whiteness, distress, collective
efficacy, and sense of belonging. These findings attest to the importance of using personcentered techniques to empirically support the ecological framework for understanding
multiracial identity.
